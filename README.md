# IE440 Fall19 - Homework 2

This is the second homework of IE440 Nonlinear Models in Optimization lesson. The topic of the homework is **facility location problems**.

Group members are:
* [M. Akın Elden](https://github.com/akinelden)
* [Yunus Emre Karataş](https://github.com/yunusskaratas)
* [Y. Harun Kıvrıl](https://github.com/harunkivril)
* [Sefa Kayraklık](https://github.com/sefak)

The objective of the homework is solving 4 different location-allocation problems:
* Single facility location with Squared Euclidean distance (Analytical solution)
* Single facility location with Euclidean distance (Weiszfeld's algorithm)
* Multi facility location with Squared Euclidean distance (ALA heuristics with analytical solution)
* Multi facility location with Euclidean distance (ALA heuristics with Weiszfeld's algorithm)
